Recent attempts to sample scientific research in psychology, economics, and medicine however have shown that more scientific papers fail than pass manual replication tests. Consequently, several attempts have been made to find ways to efficiently extend replication studies, including new statistics, surveys, and prediction markets. However new statistics have been very slowly adopted and the high costs associated with surveys and prediction markets makes these methods impractical for estimating the reproducibility of more than a few hundred studies out of the vast stock of millions of research papers that are used as building blocks for current and future work. The research aims to develop metrics and tools to help make replication studies of existing work more efficient with one additional benefit: to help scientists, scholars, and technologists self-evaluate their work before publishing it.\nThis project combines efforts to create new datasets, ‘reproducibility’ metrics, and machine learning models that estimate a confidence level in the reproducibility of a published work. The deliverables will include new datasets covering the success and failure of hundreds of scientific papers in psychology and economics and their related subfields. The metrics will go beyond a binary classification of whether a publication is estimated to be reproducible or not. They will quantify a level of confidence that the work is likely to be reproducible. The machine learning models will also help scientists interpret and explain confidence scores, which aid scientists in learning about the factors that correlate with reproducibility. In all three areas, the project will aim to provide scientists with better tools to evaluate the reproducibility of their own and others’ work, creating a better foundation of knowledge for advancing research.\nFigure 2: Citation rates of reproducible and non-reproducible studies.\nTeam  \rHamed Alhoori (PI) \rDavid Koop (Co/PI) \rBrian Uzzi (PI, Northwestern University) \rAkhil Pandey PhD student \rColin Brown PhD student \rMohammed Murtuza Shahzad Syed PhD student \rA S M Shahadat Hossain PhD student \rOmer Bin Ali Bajubair MS student  Collaborators  \rMona Rahimi  Publications   Koop, D.

Due to the sheer amount of research published and the growth of ever-changing interdisciplinary areas, researchers need an efficient way to identify important scholarly work. The number of citations a given research publication has accrued has been used for this purpose, but these take time to occur and longer to accumulate. In this article, we use altmetrics to predict the short-term and long-term citations that a scholarly publication could receive. We build various classification and regression models and evaluate their performance, finding neural networks and ensemble models to perform best for these tasks. We also find that Mendeley readership is the most important factor in predicting the early citations, followed by other factors such as the academic status of the readers (e.g., student, postdoc, professor), followers on Twitter, online post length, author count, and the number of mentions on Twitter, Wikipedia, and across different countries.","tags":["\"Citation count\"","\"Citation prediction\"","\"Altmetrics\"","\"Scientometrics\"","\"Scholarly communication\"","\"Social media\"","\"Science of science\"","\"Scholarly impact\"","\"Metascience\"","\"machine learning\""],"title":"Early indicators of scientific impact: Predicting citations with altmetrics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mahmoud Desouky","Murtada Saleh Aljawad","Hamed Alhoori","Dhafer Al-Shehri"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627998472,"objectID":"88feaeea5ffe689c53f04d6c80d4fcf2","permalink":"https://alhoori.github.io/publication/desouky-2020-spe/","publishdate":"2021-08-03T13:47:52.813147Z","relpermalink":"/publication/desouky-2020-spe/","section":"publication","summary":"The successful design of an acid fracture job requires accurate prediction of fractured well productivity. Productivity estimation demands knowledge of both the acid penetration length and conductivity distribution for the given reservoir. The literature includes several models developed to predict the conductivity of acid fractured rock. The most popular is empirical and based on measuring the conductivity of 25 acid fracture experiments. The present research provides empirical models utilizing machine learning techniques and incorporating 97 experiments and 563 datapoints. We conducted an extensive literature review to collect the published data on acid fracture experiments. The objective of such experiments is to measure conductivity at different formation closure stresses while considering field conditions. We used several data preprocessing techniques to clean the data, fill in missing values, exclude outliers and failed experiments, and standardize the dataset. Regularization was employed to eliminate features that didn't contribute to accurate prediction. Feature engineering was used to construct new features from our dataset. We began by measuring the correlations between features to better understand the data. We then built various machine learning models to predict acid fracture conductivity. It has been observed that developing one universal empirical correlation often results in significant errors in conductivity estimation because different rock types result in different etching patterns that cannot be explained by a single correlation. For instance, the channeling etching pattern is mostly observed in limestone formations, while a roughness pattern is seen in dolomite and chalk rock. Moreover, the conductivities of etching patterns formed in chalk, dolomite, and limestone formations behave differently. We built machine learning classification techniques to determine the most likely etching patterns (e.g., channeling, roughness). A linear regression-based model was then developed as a baseline for comparison with other models generated through ridge regression. We evaluated the performances of our models using well-known metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, mean squared error, and correlation coefficients. We also employed cross-validation to avoid over-fitting, finding that certain features were the most important in predicting acid fracture conductivity. Detailed empirical conductivity correlations and models were developed in this work for three carbonate rock types. Previously, a single empirical model has often been employed to estimate acid fracture conductivity or, at best, a model has been developed for a particular rock type. Most models have not considered the impact of etching patterns on conductivity, which was found to be significant in limestone.","tags":["\"machine learning\"","\"Petroleum Engineering\""],"title":"Evaluating the Effects of Acid Fracture Etching Patterns on Conductivity Estimation Using Machine Learning Techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588638393,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588638393,"objectID":"1e8b816c9746bf36ccd4d8b1c5054045","permalink":"https://alhoori.github.io/post/akhil/","publishdate":"2020-05-05T00:26:33.55Z","relpermalink":"/post/akhil/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Congratulations to Akhil Pandey for successfully defending his MS thesis and starting his PhD!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Ashiqur Rahman","Venkata Devesh Reddy Seethi","Simon Shulgan","Rui Zhang","Ehsan Mohammadi","Hamed Alhoori"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627998473,"objectID":"d8bcacd6b55ec19665cfae4c6e8131c2","permalink":"https://alhoori.github.io/publication/ashiqur-2020-bots/","publishdate":"2021-08-03T13:47:53.003482Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ashiqur-2020-bots/","section":"publication","summary":"Given its ascendancy as a way to make connections worldwide, social media is affecting all areas of people’s lives.

Emotional responses to scientific findings often play a pivotal role in these core issues. When there is too much diversity of opinion on topics of science, emotions flare up and give rise to conflict. This conflict threatens positive outcomes for research. Emotions have the power to shape how people process new information. They can color the public's understanding of science, motivate policy positions, even change lives. And yet little work has been done to evaluate the public's emotional response to science using quantitative methods. In this paper, we use a dataset of responses to scholarly articles on Facebook to analyze the dynamics of emotional valence, intensity, and diversity. We present a novel way of weighting click-based reactions that increases their comprehensibility, and use these weighted reactions to develop new metrics of aggregate emotional responses. We use our metrics along with LDA topic models and statistical testing to investigate how users' emotional responses differ from one scientific topic to another. We find that research articles related to gender, genetics, or agricultural/environmental sciences elicit significantly different emotional responses from users than other research topics. We also find that there is generally a positive response to scientific research on Facebook, and that articles generating a positive emotional response are more likely to be widely shared---a conclusion that contradicts previous studies of other social media platforms.

Twitter provides a crucial resource for monitoring legal and illegal drug sales in order to support the larger goal of finding ways to protect patient safety. We collected our dataset using Arabic keywords. We then categorized the data using four machine learning classifiers.

Although scholarly products are available in abundance—especially in environments created by the advent of social networking services—little is known about international scholarly information needs, information-seeking behavior, or information use. The purpose of this paper is to address these gaps via an in-depth analysis of the information needs and information-seeking behavior of researchers, both students and faculty, at two universities, one in the USA and the other in Qatar. Based on this analysis, the study identifies and describes new behavior patterns on the part of researchers as they engage in the information-seeking process. The analysis reveals that the use of academic social networks has notable effects on various scholarly activities. Further, this study identifies differences between students and faculty members in regard to their use of academic social networks, and it identifies differences between researchers according to discipline. Although the researchers who participated in the present study represent a range of disciplinary and cultural backgrounds, the study reports a number of similarities in terms of the researchers’ scholarly activities.","tags":["\"Information needs\"","\"Information-seeking behavior\"","\"Information organization\"","\"Scholarly communication\"","\"Reference management\"","\"Social media\"","\"Academic social network\"","\"Scholarly big data\""],"title":"Anatomy of scholarly information behavior patterns in the wake of academic social media platforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Add your privacy policy here and set draft: false to publish it.

However, according to theorists, learners struggle to identify and retrieve the optimal case to solve a new problem. Given the challenges novice face during case retrieval, recommender systems can be embedded in case libraries to support the decision-making process about which case is most relevant to solve new problems. This emerging technology reports how experts’ assessment of case relevancy was used to retrieve and suggest the most relevant cases for the learner as they engaged in an inquiry-based learning. Specifically, our case library learning system integrates a content-based filtering, which recommends items similar to those a user has selected based on item descriptions or other user data, and is most widely used in textual domains. Implications for practice are also discussed.","tags":["\"recommendation system\"","\"Case-based reasoning\"","\"Problem solving\"","\"Case retrieval\"","\"education\"","\"machine learning\""],"title":"Using a Recommendation System to Support Problem Solving and Case-Based Reasoning Retrieval","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Harish Varma Siravuri","Akhil Pandey Akella","Christian Bailey","Hamed Alhoori"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627998473,"objectID":"a3dffa4ac04485270b568008fe1b3042","permalink":"https://alhoori.github.io/publication/harish-2018-jcdl/","publishdate":"2021-08-03T13:47:53.634238Z","relpermalink":"/publication/harish-2018-jcdl/","section":"publication","summary":"People often struggle to understand scientific texts, which leads to miscommunication and often to inaccurate and even sensationalistic reports of research.

We collected our data from an academic social network and modeled researchers’ scholarly reading behavior in order to propose a new and adaptive implicit rating technique for venues. We present a way to recommend relevant, specialized scholarly venues using these implicit ratings that can provide quick results, even for new researchers without a publication history and for emerging scholarly venues that do not yet have an impact factor.

In addition, an increasing number of researchers are using academic social networks to discover and store scholarly content. The spread of scientific discourse and research activities across the web, especially on social media platforms, suggests that far-reaching changes are taking place in scholarly communication and the geography of science. This dissertation provides integrated techniques and methods designed to address the information overload problem facing scholarly environments and to enhance the research process. There are four main contributions in this dissertation. First, this study identifies, quantifies, and analyzes international researchers’ dynamic scholarly information behaviors, activities, and needs, especially after the emergence of social media platforms. The findings based on qualitative and quantitative analysis report new scholarly patterns and reveals differences between researchers according to academic status and discipline. Second, this study mines massive scholarly datasets, models diverse multidimensional non-traditional web-based indicators (altmetrics), and evaluates and predicts scholarly and societal impact at various levels. The results address some of the limitations of traditional citation-based metrics and broaden the understanding and utilization of altmetrics. Third, this study recommends scholarly venues semantically related to researchers’ current interests. The results provide important up-to-the-minute signals that represent a closer reflection of research interests than post-publication usage-based metrics. Finally, this study develops a new scholarly framework by supporting the construction of online scholarly communities and bibliographies through reputation-based social collaboration, through the introduction of a collaborative, self-promoting system for users to advance their participation through analysis of the quality, timeliness and quantity of contributions. The framework improves the precision and quality of social reference management systems. By analyzing and modeling digital footprints, this dissertation provides a basis for tracking and documenting the impact of scholarship using new models that are more akin to reading breaking news than to watching a historical documentary made several years after the events it describes.","tags":[],"title":"Mining, Modeling, and Leveraging Multidimensional Web Metrics to Support Scholarly Communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hamed Alhoori","Sagnik Ray Choudhury","Tarek Kanan","Richard Furuta","Edward A Fox","C Lee Giles"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627998475,"objectID":"ce28c6d726e7bcf7686ff7f211f2f50d","permalink":"https://alhoori.github.io/publication/alhoori-2015-open/","publishdate":"2021-08-03T13:47:54.984382Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alhoori-2015-open/","section":"publication","summary":"A new and diverse set of online metrics are emerging to capture the effects of the sharing and discussion of research articles on online platforms.

We compare JSI against diverse citation-based metrics, and find that JSI significantly correlates with a number of them. These findings indicate that online attention of scholarly articles is related to traditional journal rankings and favors journals with a longer history of scholarly impact. We also find that journal-level altmetrics have strong significant correlations among themselves, compared with the weak correlations among article-level altmetrics. Another finding is that Mendeley and Twitter have the highest usage and coverage of scholarly activities. Among individual altmetrics, we find that the readership of academic social networks have the highest correlations with citation-based metrics.

We also highlighted some requirements and solutions appropriate for future international digital libraries and social reference management systems.","tags":["\"Scholarly big data\"","\"social media\""],"title":"The Evolution of Scholarly Digital Library Needs in an International Environment: Social Reference Management Systems and Qatar","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hamed Alhoori","Richard Furuta"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627998476,"objectID":"751eebe01128369f9e53300a4d1df934","permalink":"https://alhoori.github.io/publication/alhoori-2011-tpdl/","publishdate":"2021-08-03T13:47:56.755784Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alhoori-2011-tpdl/","section":"publication","summary":"We conducted a study with an objective to learn more about the dynamic information needs, information-seeking behavior, information use and other scholarly activities of researchers. Our focus was on the collaborative and social usage and on the social reference managers. We compared the current practices and strategies of scholars and researchers from multidisciplinary research areas. Our findings provide valuable insights and augment the understanding of how the social web is having a significant effect on the current researchers' activities and digital libraries.","tags":["\"social media\"","\"Scholarly communication\"","\"Research community\"","\"Digital Libraries\"","\"Information Seeking\"","\"Social web\"","\"Social reference management\"","\"Social Bookmarking\"","\"Knowledge management\"","\"Literature review\"","\"Scholarly big data\""],"title":"Understanding the Dynamic Scholarly Research Needs and Behavior as Applied to Social Reference Management","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eduardo Urbina","Richard Furuta","Hamed Alhoori","Jie Deng","Ana Claudia HernÃ¡ndez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627998472,"objectID":"de1ab9758f32645defd696959051f830","permalink":"https://alhoori.github.io/publication/urbina-2009/","publishdate":"2021-08-03T13:47:52.561024Z","relpermalink":"/publication/urbina-2009/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"Miguel de Cervantes\"","\"digital humanities\""],"title":"\\\"El texto como hipertexto: la edición variorum del Quijote\\\"","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Muniz Apresa","E Urbina","R Furuta","H Alhoori","O Alvarez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627998477,"objectID":"1454d881b74a5d51824eb03e6e0e7f1c","permalink":"https://alhoori.github.io/publication/apresa-2009-evaluating/","publishdate":"2021-08-03T13:47:57.146774Z","relpermalink":"/publication/apresa-2009-evaluating/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"education\""],"title":"Evaluating Digital Libraries through Pedagogical and Technological Concepts: The Case of Cibo/Cervantes International Bibliography from Cervantes Project","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hamed Alhoori","Omar Alvarez","Richard Furuta","Miguel Muñiz","Eduardo Urbina"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627998477,"objectID":"603c63528002982949080470bba0e1a2","permalink":"https://alhoori.github.io/publication/alhoori-2009-ecdl/","publishdate":"2021-08-03T13:47:57.357193Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alhoori-2009-ecdl/","section":"publication","summary":"Bibliographic digital libraries play a significant role in conducting research and, in the past few years, have started to move from closed to more open social platforms. However, in this, they have faced challenges (e.g., from Web spam) in maintaining the level of scholarly precision---the ratio of relevant citations retrieved by search. This paper describes a hybrid approach that uses online social collaboration and reputation based social moderation to reduce the cost and to speed up the construction of scholarly bibliographies that are comprehensive, have better quality citations and higher precision. We implemented selected social features for an established digital humanities project (the Cervantes Project) and compared the results with a number of closed and open current bibliographies. We found this can help in building scholarly bibliographies and significantly improve precision outcomes.","tags":["\"Social collaboration\"","\"social moderation\"","\"social reputation\"","\"CSCW\"","\"Bibliographies\""],"title":"Supporting the Creation of Scholarly Bibliographies by Communities through Online Reputation Based Social Collaboration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hamed Alhoori","Omar Alvarez","Miguel Muniz","Richard Furuta","Eduardo Urbina"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627998477,"objectID":"83747a4216bdcc72475ff9a2f900745c","permalink":"https://alhoori.github.io/publication/alhoori-2009-dh/","publishdate":"2021-08-03T13:47:56.965224Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alhoori-2009-dh/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"digital humanities\"","\"social collaboration\"","\"cscw\""],"title":"Supporting the Creation of Scholarly Bibliographies by Communities through Social Collaboration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hamed Alhoori","Omar Alvarez","Richard Furuta","Du Li","Eduardo Urbina"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627998477,"objectID":"21eea39cad575de252519bc92d1c5501","permalink":"https://alhoori.github.io/publication/alhoori-2008-building/","publishdate":"2021-08-03T13:47:57.546958Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alhoori-2008-building/","section":"publication","summary":"New Web technologies could enhance collaboration within humanities digital libraries. We have investigated possible extensions to the Cervantes Project’s digital library that support collaboration across the collection of materials centering on the author of Don Quixote’s life and works. We describe the basis for our extensions, drawing from the experiences of users of the collection, and the implementation of an integrated collaborative environment that improves collaboration between users of the library through well-known Web 2.0 technologies. The resulting system provides an initial step towards building a humanities-centered Digital Community.","tags":["\"cscw\"","\"Social collaboration\""],"title":"Building Digital Communities and Supporting Collaboration in a Humanities Digital Library","type":"publication"}]
