 abstract = {Acid-fracturing operations are mainly applied in tight carbonate formations to create a highly conductive path. Estimating the conductivity of a hydraulic fracture is essential for predicting the fractured well productivity. Several models were developed previously to estimate the conductivity of acid-fractured rocks. In this research, machine learning methods were applied to 560 acid fracture experimental datapoints to develop several conductivity correlations that honor the rock types and etching patterns. Developing one universal correlation often results in significant error. To develop conductivity correlations, various data preprocessing methods were applied to remove the outliers and failed experiments. Features that did not contribute to precise predictions were removed through regularization. A machine learning classifier was built to predict the etching pattern based on the input data. We generated a multivariate linear regression model and compared it with other models generated through ridge regression. In addition to that, artificial neural network-based model was proposed to predict the fracture conductivity of several carbonate rocks such as dolomite, chalk, and limestone. The performance of the developed models was assessed using well-known metrics such as precision, accuracy, mean squared error, recall, and correlation coefficients. Cross-validation was also employed to assure accuracy and avoid overfitting. The classifier accuracy was 93%, while the regression model resulted in a relatively high correlation coefficient.},
