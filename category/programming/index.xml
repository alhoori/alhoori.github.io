      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;purpose&#34;&gt;Purpose&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hobby I have picked up recently is growing succulents and cacti from seed.
I have sown &lt;em&gt;Lithops&lt;/em&gt; and one batch of &lt;em&gt;Astrophytum&lt;/em&gt;, but still have a bunch more seeds ready for another batch.
The goal of this app is to help me track their progress and keep notes on my husbandry.
It records how many seed and when I sowed.
Further, it tracks their germination rate over time and has a handy section where I can record my notes on the process.
Finally, I can visually record their progress in a library of photos.&lt;/p&gt;
